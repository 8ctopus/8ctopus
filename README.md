Hi there! I'm a freediver, software developer, and entrepreneur passionate about building robust, open-source projects.

As a full-stack developer with a backend preference, I primarily work in php, html, and javascript. I focus on creating simple, low-complexity code that stands the test of time. Some of my projects have been running smoothly for 20 years without a major rewrite.

I began programming as a kid on the Commodore C64 (basic) and later moved to the Amiga 500 (assembly), where I created an intro and trainer for the game _Rick Dangerous_. With the slow death of Amiga, I moved to Intel PCs and started developing in C and C++, and reverse-engineering with OllyDbg.

Thanks for stopping by â€” happy coding!
